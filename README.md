## Coding style
1. Each different functional code or series classes need to be contain in a tab (aka. processing file).
2. Follow the rule of extends. (ex. MenuButton needed to extends ElementUI or colorPicker needed to extends Window, and Window Extends ElementUI)
3. don't miss-up the name of variables. using Camel-Case.
5. some functional variable needed to be contained into classes.
